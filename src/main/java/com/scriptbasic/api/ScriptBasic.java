/**
 * ScriptBasic for Java embedding interface.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the native methods that can be used to embed
 * ScriptBasic into applications. Using the methods of this API you can load,
 * execute BASIC programs, define how the interpreter can get access to other
 * sources that are included by the script, set and get global variables and
 * call subroutines.
 * <p>
 * Deprecated methods are replaced by fluent api methods that return "this". The deprecated
 * method are not for removal. They are not to be used by callers, but they are to be implemented
 * by implementing classes. These methods are invoked from the fluent API method default implementations
 * in this interface. That way the builder pattern like fluent api does not need to be implemented by
 * each class that implements the interface.

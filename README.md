jScriptBasic
============

ScriptBasic for Java (also jScriptBasic, jsb or sb4j). This implementation is a total rewrite of the ScriptBasic ideas in Java.

sb4j is a BASIC interpreter written in Java. You can embed the interpreter into Java application so you can provide the domain experts a language to extend/modify the functionality of your application. The interpreter is a perfect fit, when you want to have a scripting language that is simple. If you use groovy, scala, clojure as an embedded scripting laguage the script creation task still may be a burden on developers of high cost. When this is BASIC even the "once-IT-guy" managers will be able and will dare to play with it lowering your support cost and increasing customer satisfaction.

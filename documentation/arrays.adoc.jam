= ScriptBasic for Java Arrays

The language implemented by ScriptBasic for Java can handle arrays.
The arrays are allocated on the fly and are indexed from zero up to their limits.
If you try to index an array above the actual limit the array is automatically extended.

The following program creates an array and sorts it with the simplest possible bubble sort:

{%BASIC bubble_sort%}

The output of the program is

{%OUTPUT bubble_sort%}

The length of an array can be retrieved using the function `length()`.

{%BASIC array_length%}

This program will print out

{%OUTPUT array_length%}

Note that arrays are indexed from zero up.
Although in the program above we did not assign any value to the elements 0 and 1, they are allocated.
This means that the index values that hold meaningful values are from `0` to `length(array)-1`.

When you use an index that is larger than `length(array)-1` the array will automatically be extended with undefined members.
It is very easy to allocate really great amount of memory in ScriptBasic for Java using some large index values when setting or reading array elements.

To prevent the creation of too large arrays ScriptBasic can be configured with the configuration key `arrayMaxIndex` to limit the maximum size an array can be indexed with.
If an index is larger than the configured limit the BASIC interpreter will throw an exception.

/**
 * Abstract class to be extended by source path implementations that include a
 * file only once and which include file only using full path and use source
 * path to find the file.
 * <p>
 * The {@code NonRelative} source providers fall back to the functionality of
 * the single parameter method {@code get()} from the version that also
 * specifies the name of the file where the include statement is. In other words
 * for such source provider it is indifferent which file includes the included
 * file. Still in other words it is not possible to include a source using
 * relative source (file) name.

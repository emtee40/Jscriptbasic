 * An interpreter hook can be registered into an interpreter and the methods of

 * Hooks usually are extension means to implement profilers, debuggers and so
 * on.
 * <p>
 * The hooks are in a chain and every hook method should call the same hook
 * method on the next hook object on the chain. The hooks are chained backward.
 * The last hook will be called directly by the interpreter and that hook will
 * call the previous and so on. Thus the first hook registered is called last
 * and the last registered will be called first.
 * <p>
 * A hook method can decide for some good reason to break the chain not invoking
 * the next element in the chain.

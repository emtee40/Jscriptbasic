/**
 * Keep a registry of methods. The Java methods (either class or object method)
 * can be called from BASIC. The problem is that Java methods can be overloaded
 * and BASIC functions can not. To overcome this issue the BASIC program has to
 * declare a function name for each method it wants to call. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * method sin from java.lang.Math is (double) use as sinus
 * </pre>
 *
 * Here the method {@code sin} is to be used from the java package
 * {@code java.lang.Math} and the alias is {@code sinus}. The
 * {@code use as sinus} part is optional. In that case the alias of the function
 * is the original name of the function.
 * <p>
 * If there are two methods of the same name, with different signature, you have
 * to define different aliases for the different methods.
 * <p>
 * Not that you can use the same alias for different methods in different
 * packages.
 * <p>
 * Also note that you can also use aliases for Class names.
 * <p>
 * The registry keeps track of the name of the method, the alias, the class and
 * the signature. Thus whenever there is a function call in BASIC to call a Java
 * method in a certain class this registry will know which signature to use for
 * the certain alias.

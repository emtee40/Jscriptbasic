            <div class="section"><h2>What is ScriptBasic for Java<a name="What_is_ScriptBasic_for_Java"></a></h2><p>ScriptBasic for Java is a scripting implementation of the classic <a href="./basic.html">basic</a> language. Using this interpreter you can extend you application with BASIC scripting possibilities. There are many scripting languages that can be embedded into Java application. Different languages have different capabilities and different target users' group. ScriptBasic for Java targets the applications that are to be extended using scripts by users who are not programmers.</p><div class="section"><h3>No freak out language <a name="No_freak_out_language"></a></h3><p>Business analysts, domain experts who use an application can learn Groovy, JavaScript, Scala or some other scripting language to program the scripting possibilities of the application. They probably will not learn. In case of BASIC this learning is not needed. If anything is known by such a user BASIC is. This also means that the &quot;freak out&quot; factor is minimal. Your prospective users may freak out hearing that the application can be scripted using Groovy or Scala or JavaScript which all are considered geek languages. In case of BASIC this does not happen. If the prospective user has minimal affinity to programming he or she has some experience using Excel and its BASIC, Visual Basic or just any other BASIC.</p><p>For the same reason the language implemented is very simple. It implements only a very limited set of commands and operators. Each command is implemented that is needed to create embedded scripts but nothing more. You can assign values to variables, loop, execute conditional code (IF statement), print to the standard output and call subroutines. You can handle arrays. Anything else you need in a BASIC script? To communicate with the embedding application more than just printing to the output the program can call Java static methods or instance methods in case an object is stored in a BASIC variable. To do that the usual <tt>object.method(params)</tt> format can be used, or just <tt>method(params)</tt> when it is not ambiguous.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>Control remains at the hand of the application<a name="Control_remains_at_the_hand_of_the_application"></a></h3><p>Script languages may pose security risks if not properly configured . When you start a script it can access the application Java objects, methods and so on. You have to pay great attention to execute other language scripts securely setting up SecurityManager. To avoid a hacking script get feral.</p><p>To execute jScriptBasic all you have to do is to configure the optional RunLimitHook included in the interpreter JAR file to limit the execution and specify what the script is allowed to do and what it is not allowed to do.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>Standard Interface<a name="Standard_Interface"></a></h3><p>To embed ScriptBasic for Java into your application you can (and you are suggested to) use the standard JSR-223 interface. This way you can embed just any scripting language easily without further programming. As a matter of fact the <tt>main()</tt> method of the class <tt>com.scriptbasic.main.CommandLine</tt> uses solely this interface and as a side effect you can use the command line version of ScriptBasic for Java to execute JavaScript files utilizing the JRE7 built in Rhino engine. It is a feature that was not designed by the developers of ScriptBasic for Java. It just happens to be a fact that using the JSR-223 interface if the extension of the script file is <tt>.js</tt> then the Rhino interpreter will start.</p><p>If an application properly uses the JRS-223 interface, integrating jScriptBasic as another scripting language to the application is simply copying the <tt>jscriptbasic-x.y.z.jar</tt> file on the classpath and restart the application.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>Command line tool<a name="Command_line_tool"></a></h3><p>You can also execute BASIC programs from the command line. All you have to do is issue the command line</p><div><pre>java -jar jscriptbasic-x.y.z.jar basicProgram.sb</pre></div><p>and the program in the file <tt>basicProgram.sb</tt> will execute.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>License is Open Source<a name="License_is_Open_Source"></a></h3><p>ScriptBasic for Java is licensed with the GPLv3 license. If you need commercial license contact the developers. At the early, intial stage of the project expect easy deals for the introductory period.</p></div></div>
